#summary How to build hibernate-memcached from source.

=Get the code=
Check out the code from Subversion.
svn checkout http://hibernate-memcached.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/hibernate-memcached

=Install Maven 2=
If you already have maven installed you can skip this. If you need maven2 you can get it from http://maven.apache.org/ or I highly recommend using the Don Brown fork, maven 2.0.8-db. Don Brown got fed up with some of the crap Maven2 was doing and forked it, and I dig it. http://people.apache.org/~mrdon/maven-db/
Extract Maven and add it to your path so that you can run mvn from the command line. If you can't figure this out, you're on your own.

=Build with Maven 2=
mvn install

Please note that the unit tests expect to find a single memcached running at localhost:11211. If one is not running the unit tests will fail. To get around this if necessary run "mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true".

=The Future...=
In the future I'll move this source code to git, and I'll build it with buildr or gant. For now, the instructions above are the way to go.
